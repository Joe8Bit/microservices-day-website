        <h2><img src="images/logo.svg">Why Attend?</h2>
        <HR>
        <p>Microservices Day is a one-day, single-track, non-profit event that focuses on the business benefits of utilizing microservices. It is aimed at chief digital officers, chief technical officers, chief information officers, VPs of engineering and senior tech decision makers. Learn how leading enterprises are leveraging digital transformation to achieve rapid delivery and be inspired, not intimidated, by the unicorns.</p>

        <h2><img src="images/logo.svg">Aims of the Event</h2>
        <HR>
        <p>The event aims to bring together two worlds: technology unicorns and traditional enterprises.</p>
        <p>Technology unicorns RedHat, Zalando, AutoScout 24, Netflix, Uber and Groupon will be talking about the speed they have been able to achieve as cloud-native technology companies, and about the state-of-the art of technologies they’re creating using the microservice architecture.</p>
        <p>Traditional enterprises such as McKinsey, ADP, and TES will be talking about their transformations from traditional enterprises where technology is an enabler to technology companies where technology is a differentiator. These companies will be sharing real world lessons learned during this transition. Each company will talk about the journey they have been on from a business perspective as they transition to applying an engineering mindset to their business.</p>
        <p>The discussions during microservices day will focus on where the microservice architecture is going as a technology, and how enterprises can use it for competitive advantage.</p>

                        <p>The microservices architecture brings with it all the challenges of distributed systems, not least the need for services to find each other. Gossip protocol algorithms such as SWIM mean that microservices can do away with the service discovery issue altogether, relying instead on an evolving, dynamic map of their local network. This talk examines the use of the SWIM algorithm to build a Twitter clone in Node.js, one microservice at a time.</p>

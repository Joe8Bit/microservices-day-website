    "abstract": "The microservices architecture brings with it all the challenges of distributed systems, not least the need for services to find each other. Gossip protocol algorithms such as SWIM mean that microservices can do away with the service discovery issue altogether, relying instead on an evolving, dynamic map of their local network. This talk examines the use of the SWIM algorithm to build a Twitter clone in Node.js, one microservice at a time.",

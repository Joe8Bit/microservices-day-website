  "blurb": "The Microservices Day London organizers believe in diversity—but we want to go beyond the clichés associated with the word, as well. We’d rather just state that we want the best speakers and awesome attendees, and in order to find them, we cast the widest net possible. In other words, we’re proud that our people are the best. If some of them happen to be (gasp!) women, black, transgender, gay, disabled, or otherwise not a straight, able-bodied caucasian male (though we like them, too)–we’re still proud."
